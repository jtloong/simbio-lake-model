# Simbio Lake Model

Analysis of Simbio lake simulation using different nutrient controls.

[SimBio](https://simbio.com/products-college/Ecology) is a ecologogical labroratory software to create simulated lake scenarios that allow you to control for different nutrient conditions. This repo holds my analysis code of my results for one of my simulations.
